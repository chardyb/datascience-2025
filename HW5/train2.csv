Expansive walls of multi-slide glass panel doors cover the entire length of the deck inviting the outdoors in... and the indoors out. Statement-making features continue in the kitchen, complete with double island, high-end stainless appliances, and modern finishes that make for a high-style kitchen game-changer. Hardwood floors grace the entire main floor, a gas fireplace and check out our artsy wood paneled wall. The entertaining options are endless here and no shortage of comfortable spots to take in the view. Our primary bedroom and bath are where modern meets luxury--gas fireplace, grand walk-in closet and gorgeous spa-like bath await. Additional airy bedroom and bath round out the aesthetic in our unordinary upstairs living space. No gloomy basement here--it\'s a whole second living space! Light & bright, a full kitchenette, two large bedrooms, two ultra-cool baths, and walkout can\'t be beat (we\'re thinking accessory apartment or the perfect guest quarters). Exterior spaces are built for summer living, and we\'ve got you covered. The oh-so-private backyard has been freshly landscaped and a pergola-covered patio added--go ahead, have people over. We are located a few mere steps to access the Bonneville Trail for that early morning hike or easy spot to take in a glorious Salt Lake sunset.

As perfectly located as it is updated...This beautiful bungalow on 10th Avenue is touting the sort of features that make this neighborhood so very sought after. In addition to all the charm you\'d expect from a well-maintained property built in the early 1900s, there are plenty of updates here to make life just a touch easier all-around. In 2022, the home got a new furnace, air conditioning, humidifier, and UV air purification system, and earlier this year, the front lawn saw both new sod and an entirely replaced sprinkler system, including pipes and irrigation. Additionally, gutters have been added to the perimeter of the home to help direct water runoff away from the foundation (and existing gutters were replaced). But the interior of this property is where you\'ll find the sort of upgrades that make for both a worry-free and aesthetically pleasing life. We\'ll start with the pop-out windows in the living and dining spaces, which bring in a good deal of natural light and work in tandem with high ceilings to make both spaces feel substantially more open (and, in the former, lends the perfect spot for a good book). The kitchen is sleek and modern with a large island that lends countertop space for prep dining (a great use of the space in this home). A small set of stairs walk up to another sitting area-complete with cute fireplace-which walks directly out to the patio through a set of French doors (where you\'ll find space enough out here for plenty of string lights, a good dining table, and a sitting area/fire pit). The primary bedroom is equipped with a walk-in closet and beautifully updated ensuite, and you\'ll find a basement with plenty of room for all your storage needs. Considering that you\'re also within walking distance to City Creek Canyon and Bonneville Shoreline Trail, this, we dare say, is the perfect Avenues find.

This mid-century prize, perhaps subtly influenced by the works of Frank Lloyd Wright, reflects the inspiration she drew from visiting his homes. Enamored by the rich warmth of reddish Roman brick, she selected it to adorn the exterior, perfectly complementing the long, low lines of its ranch-style architecture. Being tall herself, Frances envisioned a space with tall ceilings; the shed roofline achieved this while simultaneously framing the sweeping valley views below. The carport, integrated into the natural slope of the lot, anchors the home nicely.  Intent on maximizing convenience, Frances ensured that the home included a main-floor laundry area, complete with a linen cabinet tucked neatly behind the washer and dryer-eliminating the need for trips downstairs. The kitchen is a model of mid-century efficiency, with custom cabinetry for china and linens, along with pull-out worktops at varying heights to accommodate any task. The floating staircase, a bold statement of the era, remains a beloved architectural centerpiece. The unique display window above the stairs offers a glimpse of the home\'s character, even from the street, teasing its blurred lines and angles. Downstairs, one bedroom includes an entire wall of integrated storage, while other rooms are equipped with built-in desks and drawers, all intended to maximize floor space. Frances enlisted her friend, Merline Leaming of Clark Leaming Design, to assist with the interior design. Together, they created a home that is as functional inside as it is beautiful. \""There are 9,000 ways to do a room,\"" Merline would say. \""If you don\'t like one, we\'ll find another.\"" Merline\'s design expertise is evident throughout the home, including in the distinctive downstairs bar-a beloved feature for entertaining. Frances\'s husband, meticulously planned and installed lighting throughout the house, ensuring every corner was beautifully illuminated and even wiring extra switches in anticipation of future needs.  For nearly 70 years, this home has been at the heart of Frances\'s life. From her desk in the kitchen, she watched children play in the backyard, penned articles for the local paper, and immersed herself in a world of art, travel, and architecture through her extensive book collection. Despite her vast travels, it was always this home to which she longed to return. This is a special place, rich with history, inspiration, and love.

As such, the home\'s current owners (who have lived in and loved the space for 47 years) say it has the distinct feeling of \""a single family home in the sky.\"" Built in 1961 and flooded with natural light throughout, the flow here is open and easy, and lends itself well to plenty of possibilities for furniture, layouts, updates, or additions (in other words, it\'s a unique property and a blank slate). The kitchen is clean, open, and offers ample space for storage in addition to an oversized island equipped to handle prep for dinners, drinks, and gatherings of all sizes. The main suite is spacious and well-designed, and certain to meet any and all needs for your end-of-day sanctuary. And, though every shared space within the condo is ideal, we\'d say that our favorite part would have to be the views offered from both decks. The first wraps around the south and west sides of the unit, enabling you to capitalize on SLC sunsets and downtown in all her glory. The second, east-facing deck is an ideal perch for Capitol views, morning cups of coffee, and watching the shades of the Bonneville shoreline change with the seasons. Location-wise, you can\'t top this penthouse: with quick and easy access to downtown, you\'ll be well prepared to take advantage of our city\'s ever-growing list of good restaurants, a night at the theater, or a walk down Main for an evening sip. Added bonus: for those who love travel, the elevator access to this unit can be locked, offering a touch of security when you\'re out of town (though, we think you\'ll be plenty happy to stay home).

What sets us apart from all the smaller units down the way?  Well, let us list them out for you. First, we have over 2000 sq. ft of living space; yes, we have a 2-car garage and parking space on the driveway for 3 cars. Most importantly, NO HOA. Pick your pets. But that isn\'t all we have...the ground level is perfect for work from home, you can meet and greet co-workers if you wish via the separate entry and even offer them the use of the loo! The versatility of this area is endless: home gym, romper room for the pets, extra income as a nightly rental, you can decide. With the entire home echoing today\'s love of modern leisure, we promise we have you fully covered from top to bottom. The second floor is the open living space we live in daily; the deck out back is private, and all the bedrooms are located on top for the tranquility you are seeking at night. Fenced yard, patio, and in summertime, it is all softly shaded for day and evening enjoyment. Let\'s face it: Marmalade is on the fast track of up and coming neighborhoods, and here, you can get in just as the growth is happening to enjoy all the benefits.

I asked my father for a metal detector, but he didn\'t buy into my passing childhood whims.  So, now as an adult, I\'m scanning estate sales looking for that elusive Poul Kjaerholm or Florence Knoll furniture piece.  But, what really gets me excited is when I find an architect\'s name on old blueprints inside one of these amazing homes I\'m selling.  The blueprints for this home have a signature belonging to Dan A. Weggeland.  Not much is known of Dan.  This is one of his early works, perhaps designed for someone that he knew.  This is one of only two residences that I know of by him (the other is on Hillside, just below the Capitol building).  He\'s known to have designed some small commercial projects around Salt Lake City and Ogden, an Indian Housing project in Keyents, Arizona, and a Travel Center Cafe and Lounge in Wyoming.  Like most modern homes of its era, this one is very private in front, with an extended stack stone wall.  The back of the house is a post and beam construction, framing in walls of windows.  Dan\'s design exhibits a refined minimalism, with intimate spaces that divide the interior.  His use of stone and cedar makes this house feel grounded to nature and the energy of the soft modern movement of the Pacific Northwest.  The home is designed to take in the valley and city views below.  It\'s been well cared for by the previous and current owners, with a noticeably well-tended garden that extends the living space in both the front and back of the house in the warmer months.  Dan Weggeland\'s talents are not lost on those who appreciate beauty and truly good design.
