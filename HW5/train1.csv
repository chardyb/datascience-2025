The kitchen is crisp and white with plenty of counter space, and the bedrooms here are roomy and well-positioned in the home. The property has a lovely pool, should warmer temperatures ever prevail, but for our money, we\'d say the views are the cherry on this sundae.

The McMullen is a distinctly warm blend of historic charm and modern finesse in one of our city\'s most beloved neighborhoods. Originally built in 1907, the unit has since been taken down to the studs in a full remodel that included plumbing, electrical, HVAC, earthquake bracing, and extra insulation for both energy efficiency and soundproofing. In other words, future tenants can move in with complete peace of mind to enjoy all this beautiful area has to offer. Chefs (or aspiring ones) will love the floor-to-ceiling cupboard space and open-concept kitchen space, including a small bar area for prep or quick bite. The adjacent dining area (flanked by a stunning bay window) offers a lovely spot for a small dinner party, and plant lovers will certainly be appreciative of copious natural light, plenty of windows, and tall ceilings. Two perfectly updated baths feature gorgeous tile, one with a bathtub and the other with a curbless shower, providing comfortable space and accessibility for residents and guests alike. Built-ins throughout the home offer plenty of storage, but should you need more, you\'ll find a dedicated, secured (and sizable) storage area just outside the unit. The outdoor space can\'t be beat-a covered porch is the perfect perch for a glass of something refreshing and a good read or a bit of people-watching. The area is close to downtown, but neighborhood staples like Sawadee Thai, Avenues Proper, and Cucina ensure you\'ll be well fed, even on foot. Tired of walking?

This is a statement we can all agree on. Why would you want anything less? Here you won\'t need to worry. Our masterfully designed modern home is ready for you and the way we live today. Situated in Arlington Hills, with views of the Wasatch Front Mountain Range and Salt Lake City\'s downtown skyline, this clean and classic contemporary home will envelop all of the \""ahhhh\"" you have. The fresh look pulls you to the front door from the minute you arrive. Inside, a sweeping entry opens to soaring ceiling height, floor-to-ceiling windows with views, and a gracious living space for entertaining. Arendal Kitchen Designers designed the kitchen for cooking and everyday living, all in one space. We have a great room, kitchen dining space, outdoor dining on the front balcony, and backyard access to the patio and pool. The main floor hosts a primary suite that looks like it was pulled straight out of Architectural Digest. The en-suite bath has marble flooring, with a double vanity, tranquil soaking tub, and step-in shower for two. Even the staircase entry to the lower level is artfully designed. Take a look...downstairs is all above ground and filled with daylight. Garage entry is here, a space to lounge, read, or watch a flick, and a home gym space is here, too. Extra bedrooms abound; we have 4 to choose from, and one has its own full bath. No need to drag the laundry upstairs; we have a set on each floor.  The oversized 3-car garage is a bonus, along with extra parking spaces in the driveway, so you won\'t need to Tetris cars around if you have guests or extra cars. Besides the valley and mountain views, the other gem here is our backyard oasis. The saltwater pool and in-ground spa will give you months of summer fun. Carefully crafted by the owner, this backyard space is all about a place to relax and gather. There is plenty of poolside patio, surrounded by fully mature and professionally groomed gardens. We even have a space for the pup to play on the grass! Every inch of this home has been meticulously redone and maintained over the owner\'s time here, and now you have that once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to call it yours.",Flat; Membrane,No,Salt Lake,Ensign,Bryant,West,Rowland Hall-St Mark&#039;s,,Gas: Connected; Power: Connected; Sewer: Connected; Sewer: Public; Water: Connected,Call Agent/Appt; Use Aligned Showings,0.0,Jeff Justice,Summit Sotheby\'s International Realty (Salt Lake),12500.0,5/3/2024,Conventional,5/3/2024,UT,SOLD,DR,PERRYS HOLLOW,Modern,CHANDLER POINTE,09-33-127-045,9936.0,Cash; Conventional,1,5,4,2.0,1,1,2,0,1,1,2,0,"5,524",,,Culinary,Blinds; Draperies; Full,00/00/0000,1993,84103,R-1,5/3/2024

This tidy, modern home hits something of a sweet spot at 3 beds and 4 baths in nearly 1,900 comfy square feet. There\'s a separate, secure entrance to a live/work space on the ground level, lending the opportunity to have a home office or run your own small business, should you hope to start something with a more-than-efficient commute. With its own full bathroom, however, the space is certainly not limited to work-related options: owners here can get creative, be it for a guest bedroom, a home gym, an artist\'s studio, or something that might generate a bit of rental income. On the main level just above, you\'ll find an open concept, modern kitchen, along with more of the same in the dining and living areas, and a flex area en route to a covered deck that overlooks a fully fenced yard. For those with an office away from home, there\'s quick access to the freeway, and nature buffs can enjoy sunsets at Capitol Hill or hikes at nearby Memory Grove and Ensign Peak trailhead. Residents should also consider the possibility of easy walks to Handle Bar for libations, breakfast at Marmalade Brunch House, and lazy days browsing books at the Marmalade public library. Bonus: a two-deep tandem garage means no brushing snow off of the car(s) this winter. This is a win, no matter the season.   Square footage figures are provided as a courtesy estimate only.

Custom beams over the deck create a brilliant contrast of light and shadow. Built by Dowsett Construction, the home was enhanced with stone masonry by Merrill Law and leaded glass by Willie Littig. Experience the magnificent main level living flow complete with a fireplace in the eat-in kitchen fit for entertaining, spacious living room, formal dining room, and a large primary bedroom with en-suite bathroom and abundant closet storage. Southwest views are found in every room, even the main level laundry that has a potential dog bath area. The upper level has a family room space with built-in office desks, two bedrooms, and a full bathroom. The lower level can serve as a separate apartment with a kitchenette, Murphy bed, full bathroom, and a family room accessed through the three car garage or a private door. Adjacent to the lower level is a covered patio with a wood burning fireplace. An entertainer\'s delight, the home has a circular driveway with ample guest parking leading to the property surrounded by natural scrub oak creating privacy around the multiple gathering spaces on the terraced grounds.

(don\'t panic, not on this home!).  In the model, Formica products were used throughout - on furniture, cabinets and interior walls, with contemporary styling, and was offered for $25,000-45,000. The ad said: \""Formica World\'s Fair Model Home, a ranch house that gave visitors a glimpse into the wide applications of its miraculous Space Age laminate and considered this dream home for tomorrow\'s living today is nothing short of delightful!\""  The 1964 model home, which was previewed in a 14-page article in Good Housekeeping  invited guests to ooh and aah at all that could be done with Formica, that now widely used material that was then poised to take over tables and countertops the world over.  Locally, architect and U of U professor Jim Christopher (recently deceased) who designed such well-known spaces at Snowbird, Kol Ami Synagogue, Nunemaker Place and the Rowland Hall campus created this design in Salt Lake City and now you have the opportunity of a lifetime to own this unique property in the Northcrest neighborhood (aka \'Pill Hill\')! The design emphasizes natural light throughout on both levels of the home including roof skylights and an activity terrace just off the kitchen for light from the rear yard. This can be your FOREVER home and there\'s main level living with laundry and a walk-out basement with a kitchen. Good sized rooms throughout but also allowing for privacy from each other.

When we helped clients of ours find this diamond in the rough ranch in the Upper Avenues, right away they recognized its potential: solidly built, largely untouched and priced right. It needed lots of love, and that\'s exactly what they gave it. Our talented design team was tasked with coming up with something bold yet timeless, practical though wildly sexy. And this is the result: a down to the studs, fully renovated home that is as gorgeous as it is functional. An exterior leads you into an open space concept that is equal parts bright and airy as it is provocative. Notice how well the white walls and light hardwood flooring contrast against the smoky-colored cabinets and ceiling cladding. We kept the original stone fireplace, painted it and then contrasted it with a metal and glass staircase complete with floating steps. Our clients, who work remotely, needed a space to work from home but did not want the confinement burdening most home offices, so we created a space whose glass walls ensured privacy while still remaining connected to the rest of the residence. Speaking of connectivity, another important aspect our clients wanted was the seamless connection between the inside and out, and so concertina doors were installed between the kitchen and deck. An electric awning was put in to handle the harsh sun and to extend the main floor\'s living space. We love that built-in outdoor kitchen. Can you say \'spiced salmon kabobs all year long\'? Other elements we love? How about that gorgeous slab of granite calling itself an island? It\'s beautiful and elegant and probably should have its own zip code. And the home sauna? Nothing better than after a hard day of making fresh tracks. Don\'t even get us started with those views. You can see clear to Carson City.  Set on a quarter acre of land and at just under 4,500 square feet, this modern rambler offers everything you could want in a home‚Ä\""space, functionality, warmth. Our friends brought this home to life and asked to pass along some words of wisdom to the next owners, that is you won\'t regret a minute of enjoying your life here.

Wait till you hear this one...the story is over a century old, and we are ready to paint you the portrait of how it all began. This home is not only chock full of historical treasures but decade after decade of love, care, and updates beyond your imagination by its owners. Built and owned by Dr. Ellis Reynolds Shipp, one of Utah\'s first female Physicians, she built this home, lived here, and used it as her medical office. A wife and mother in 1878, Ellis went back east to medical school while pregnant with child #6. She brought back her love of medical care to Utah and focused her practice here on obstetrics and founded a school that trained hundreds of midwives.  Way ahead of her time, this pioneering woman built this home to last for a lifetime, full of large, roomy spaces that flow beautifully together. As you enter the home, the first thing that grabs you is the soaring ceiling height and the warmth of natural wood flooring. A formal living and dining room are next adorned with original windows, all intact, and the gumwood is in perfect condition from top to bottom. Our current owner updated the kitchen and added a mudroom entry, pantry, and powder room to enhance our everyday modern living. March up the double-entry staircase to arrive at your end-of-the-day soft landing in the primary suite. We have everything you want here, bath and walk-in closet included. The extras in the additional bedrooms? One adorns top-to-bottom bookcases, a window seat, and a fireplace ever so cozy you may never want to leave. Another has a spacious upper deck looking out back and facing north for cool summer nights. The basement is no longer a cellar but a wonderful place to lounge with a bath and storage beyond your imagination. The other bragging right? The current owners had the home retrofitted during the remodel with some seismic upgrades so the house can withstand the elements for decades to come. Welcome spring in this year out back.

Such is the case with this darling home perched on the corner of C St and 7th Ave. From just its curbside charm, you know there\'s something magical inside. Built originally in 1902, the residence underwent an extensive, top to bottom renovation in 2018 with improvements including new electrical, new plumbing and new HVAC among them. The interior was opened up and modernized, turning a once modest kitchen into an entertainer\'s dream. It is the home\'s focal point. Here, you\'ll find new quartz countertops, tile backsplash, new cabinets and stainless steel appliances. For dining, there\'s a cozy spot nearby, though you\'ll likely find yourself noshing bites from the kitchen\'s generous island. Rich walnut flooring runs throughout the main floor and new carpet on the second. The ceilings are tall and there is no shortage of windows, keeping the interior feeling light and airy. On the main, you\'ll find the owner\'s suite. It comes with its own luxury bathroom and walk-in closet. There\'s also a living room that\'s just off the entry, that\'s so inviting, you may end up spending all your afternoons curled up on a sofa with a good book. There are two more bedrooms upstairs with another full bathroom. One faces south and the other west, and both receive plenty of sunlight. The scope of work continues to the outdoors where there\'s all new landscaping, new irrigation system and a two car garage. That\'s right. Two car. In the Avenues. And there\'s still room for a yard big enough to host a rigorous game of badminton. Homes like this one don\'t often come along and, when they do, they don\'t last.

Though the home was built in 1924, and countless original details are still intact, plenty of updates have been instituted throughout as well. In addition to bathroom updates, a small 2nd small kitchen was recently installed for a mother-in-law basement, and solar panels on the roof help to offset utility costs. A bit of exposed brick is the perfect kitchen accessory, and you\'ll find it again in the living room fireplace, but we particularly love the stained glass windows just next to the dining area. A pair of French doors off the primary bedroom lead to a small, flex space (used here as a music room), and from there you can walk through another set of glass doors to the small, but gorgeous backyard. No landscaping or maintenance needed back here-a small bit of paved patio is perfect for entertaining, reading quietly, or a dinner under some string lights and the moon.
